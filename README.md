# Temperature & Humdity with Buzzer Actuator
This tutorial offers instruction on setting up a temperature and humidity (DHT11) sensor with a buzzer actuator using Arduino Uno.

## Parts:
- DHT11 sensor
- Buzzer
- Breadboard
- Arduino Uno
- Jumper wires

## Download and Install
- Download and install the **Temp-Humidity-plus-Buzzer.zip** file by clicking the green *Clone* or *Download* button above and selecting *Download ZIP*
Unzip this file; all the files you'll need will be contained inside
Unzip the **DHTLib.zip** file, and drag the subsequent **DHTLib FOLDER** to the Documents/Arduino/libraries folder. This will install the necessary library in the Arduino IDE

## Create Arduino Circuit
-Open the **DHT_plus_buzzer_bb.pdf** file and follow the visual pinout instructions to set up your circuit

## IDE Code
- Double click the **DHT_Actuator.ino** file from your download and say Yes to the Arduino IDE pop-up window.
- The file should open directly in your Arduino IDE application
- Click the Compile button to be sure the code has no bugs, then plug in your Arduino circuit and Upload the code
